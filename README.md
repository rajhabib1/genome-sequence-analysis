## Key Features

- **Motif Discovery:** Find specific DNA motifs within a given sequence.
- **Reverse Complement:** Generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
- **ORF Identification:** Discover potential protein-coding regions (ORFs) within DNA sequences and translate them into amino acid sequences.

## How to Use

1. Ensure your DNA sequence is stored in the "dna_sequence.txt" file within the script's directory.
2. Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions to analyze your DNA data.

## Installation
https://github.com/rajhabib1/genome-sequence-analysis.git
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Add your DNA sequence to the "dna_sequence.txt" file within the script's directory.
3. Run the script: python genome_analysis.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to analyze your DNA data.

Empower your genetic research with the Advanced Genome Sequence Analysis Tool. Uncover hidden patterns and potential protein-coding regions in DNA sequences effortlessly.

### Motif Discovery

To find a specific DNA motif, you can modify the `motif` variable in the script. For example, to search for the motif "AGC," change the `motif` variable like this:

```python
motif = "AGC"
